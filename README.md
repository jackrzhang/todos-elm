# todos-elm

This implementation demonstrates an easy way to decouple State from
Views, via an intermediary function referred to as a `Connector`. Connectors
serve a similar purpose to container components from React-Redux, and communicate with
view functions via an `Interface`.

#### Build Instructions
Run `npm run prod`. Then open `localhost:3000` in your browser.
